## TL;DR Version

***You are free to study and play with the source code (GPL) but you are not allowed to redistribute a recompiled version of Exp3D***. 

## Assets

The game assets (sprites, images, sound effects...) remain **proprietary**, they are included here as a courtesy, for educational purpose only.  
Note that due to restrictive licensing issues, I cannot myself redistribute the original BGM songs so they are replaced with placeholder files.
